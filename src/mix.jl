## Mixing model

## Requisite: Compositional Models of inner and outer (which I am close to!)

## 2 parameters:
    # Proportion of inner vs outer solar system (outer proportion seems reasonable).
    # Fraction of solar mass

## Model structure:
    # Calculate mixed composition by adding and propagating uncs in quadrature
    # Add to composition of Sun, scaled by fraction of solar mass

## MCMC
    # loglikelihood calculation of each element vs. every solar twin.
